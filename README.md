# Personal boring tiny Neovim configuration

Made for personal use only, many of settings edited from Folke's LazyVim project. Huge thanks to Folke, helped me to learn how to use Vim/Neovim step by step.

This configuration dropped some plugins and functions to fit me more, Simpler than Lazyvim, and some looks also gets change. Personal hobbit.
